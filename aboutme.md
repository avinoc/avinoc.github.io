I grew up with gaming ever since Pong on the C64. Gaming has always been a passion of mine and I hope to share that passion with you all.

I intend to turn this blog into a resource center for the various PC game titles I play. I will post opinions pieces as well as guides and strategy summaries.

If you would like to contribute you can do so on github directly by creating a pull request to add an article to this Jekyll blog. If you are not comfortable doing so you can also email me your content at contact@avinoc.tv directly.
